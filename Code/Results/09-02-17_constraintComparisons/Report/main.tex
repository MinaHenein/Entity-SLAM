\section{Overview}

Key results:
\begin{itemize}
\item planar constraints with long walls reduce drift;
\item segmented walls allow, and even increase drift;
\item when points lie loosely on planes and plane parameters are free to adjust themselves, angle constraints improve orthogonality.
\end{itemize}

Outstanding issues:
\begin{itemize}
\item when system gets large (>200 vertices, 1000 edges) and no loop closures occur (ie corridor, corner), gauss-newton takes many iterations to converge. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
Simulation details:
\begin{itemize}
\item odometry, points measurement and plane angle constraint standard deviations were held constant
\item the same level of noise was used in generating measurements and in the estimation;
\item measurements were processed incrementally;
\item gauss-newton was used;
\item simulation was run with a) no constraints, b) planar constraints and c) planar and angle constraints;
\item simulation was run with two levels of $\sigma_{plane-plane-angle}$, ie points very close to planes \& points loosely on planes (ground truth).
\end{itemize}

Angle constraints: wall planes orthogonal to ground and parallel to directly opposite plane. Drift is not reduce by planar constraints - seems to be increasing based on figure but this is due to random seed differing, due to different system sizes. More trials show drift is the same..\newline
