\subsection{Functionality}
This library can be used to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Generate ground truth data and simulated measurements and store them in a customisable graph file format.
\item Represent graph files in a graph class structure that allows for easy manipulation  and conversion to a linearised system.
\item Solve linear systems with different solvers.
\end{itemize}
