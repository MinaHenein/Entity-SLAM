function H = sparseNull(A, thresh)
% NULLS   Null space of a sparse matrix.
%    Z = NULLS(A) is a basis for the null space of A.  That is, A*Z has
%    negligible elements and size(Z,2) is the nullity of A.  The algorithm
%    used [1] is optimized for sparse matrices.
%
%    Z = NULLS(A,thresh) controls pivoting between maximum preservation of
%    sparsity (thresh=0) and maximum accuracy (thresh=1). The default is
%    thresh=0.1.

%    Algorithms, vol. 62, no. 3, pp. 469â€“485, Jun. 2012.
%
%    Example:
%    A = sprand(1000, 1500, 0.001);
%    Z = nulls(A);
%    size(Z,2)    % at least 500, typically more, depending on A
%    norm(A*Z,1)  % should give a small value
